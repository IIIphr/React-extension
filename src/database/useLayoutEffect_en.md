# useLayoutEffect

### `useLayoutEffect(setup, dependencies?)`

Call `useLayoutEffect` to perform the layout measurements before the browser repaints the screen:

``` js
import { useState, useRef, useLayoutEffect } from 'react';

function Tooltip() {
  const ref = useRef(null);
  const [tooltipHeight, setTooltipHeight] = useState(0);

  useLayoutEffect(() => {
    const { height } = ref.current.getBoundingClientRect();
    setTooltipHeight(height);
  }, []);
  // ...
```

### Parameters

* `setup`: The function with your Effect’s logic. Your setup function may also optionally return a cleanup function. Before your component is added to the DOM, React will run your setup function. After every re-render with changed dependencies, React will first run the cleanup function (if you provided it) with the old values, and then run your setup function with the new values. Before your component is removed from the DOM, React will run your cleanup function.

* optional `dependencies`: The list of all reactive values referenced inside of the `setup` code. Reactive values include props, state, and all the variables and functions declared directly inside your component body. If your linter is configured for React, it will verify that every reactive value is correctly specified as a dependency. The list of dependencies must have a constant number of items and be written inline like `[dep1, dep2, dep3]`. React will compare each dependency with its previous value using the `Object.is` comparison. If you omit this argument, your Effect will re-run after every re-render of the component.

### Returns

`useLayoutEffect` returns `undefined`.

### Caveats

* `useLayoutEffect` is a Hook, so you can only call it at the top level of your component or your own Hooks. You can’t call it inside loops or conditions. If you need that, extract a component and move the Effect there.

* When Strict Mode is on, React will run one extra development-only setup+cleanup cycle before the first real setup. This is a stress-test that ensures that your cleanup logic “mirrors” your setup logic and that it stops or undoes whatever the setup is doing. If this causes a problem, implement the cleanup function.

* If some of your dependencies are objects or functions defined inside the component, there is a risk that they will cause the Effect to re-run more often than needed. To fix this, remove unnecessary object and function dependencies. You can also extract state updates and non-reactive logic outside of your Effect.

* Effects only run on the client. They don’t run during server rendering.

* The code inside `useLayoutEffect` and all state updates scheduled from it block the browser from repainting the screen. When used excessively, this makes your app slow. When possible, prefer `useEffect`.

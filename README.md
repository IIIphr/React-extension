# React Guide
This extension aims to provide a platform for the community to make guides for React specific functions and terms.

It is a student project, so the scope is limited. But hopefully I'll keep my motivation and find free time to develop it further.

This extension supports RTL langues, especially Persian languge since it's my mother tongue.

### How it helps?
By providing examples and documantaions right from within the editor, programmers can simply bring up a panel by right clicking on a specific function and see explanations, exmaples and helpful links that guide them to better use the React futures.

### How it works?
Right now, the vision is that I (and later along the way, the community) write around 50 guides for 50 functions and features of React in markdown format, with Persian language included (or just Persian language, depending on how much time I have). Then the developer can right click on any word in their `.js` file and see the `Show the guide panel` option at the top of the context menu. By clicking it, the extension searches for the word the developer clicked on in its databse, and if it finds a guide for it, it'll display the guide in a panel.

The guide is written in markdown (with some minor extensions for better RTL support), and will be complied into html for proper display of both RTL languages and code block highlighting.

### How can you help?
Right now, I'm writing it as a project for my bachelor degree, so I'm doing most of the work by myself. But if you're interested, you can write guides in markdown format and I'll add them to the extension!

If you are a React developer and also speak persian, you can be of great help to this project. Translating English guides into Persian ones, without losing meaning, accuracy and flow of the text takes time, skill and knowledge.

I'll complie a document later down the line on how to write a guide and add it to the extension. There will be an acceptance procedure for guranteed quality and standards of the guides and for the sake of consistency.
